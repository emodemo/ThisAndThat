Unfinished Data Structures and Algorithm for Graphs (mainly, but not only).

## Data Structures

* Left Leaned Red-Black Balanced Search Tree
* Point Quad Tree
* Point Tree: multi-dimensional implementation, where 2D == Point-QuadTree, 3D == Point-Octree, etc...
* Graph: all combinations of un/directed, un/weighted
* TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality
* dataframes - most likely NO

## Algorithms

* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Point Quad Tree - 2D query
* Point Tree - Multi-D query
* Topological Sort (with cycle detection)
* Shortest Path - bfs
* Shortest Path - Dijkstra
* Shortest Path - Bellman-Ford (with negative cycle detection)
* Shortest Path - acyclic (based on Topological sort)
* Longest Path - acyclic (based on Topological Sort)
* Critical Path
* Minimum Spanning Tree - eager Prim
* Graph Coloring - Greedy
* Graph Coloring - Degree of Saturation "DSatur"
