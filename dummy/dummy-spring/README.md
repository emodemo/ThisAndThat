## People with grades


#### Purpose
This is a small project that has learning and examination purposes. I will be using it when conducting interviews for software engineers.

#### Prologue
You can query the service with its in-memory database about:
* list of subjects
* paginated list of people
* single person
* list of grades for a person


With the latest commit I am conducting an interview that aims to show the peer review capabilities of the applicant.
